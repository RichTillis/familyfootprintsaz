					<p>It is almost impossible to determine how many Americans are directly touched by
						Adoption. Are you an adoptee? Are you a birth parent searching for your child that was
						placed for adoption? Maybe you’re a sibling or grandparent to an adoptee, or the adoptive
						parent assisting with the search for biological parents. The reason for initiating a search
						varies for each individual. Stories shared by individuals of adoption show that a majority
						of adoptees and birth parents have considered searching or have actively searched for
						their biological family at some point in their life. If you are considering the search
						process for your family member, I can help.
					</p>
					<p>Let’s start with a simple free consultation. We’ll discuss your journey that has brought
						you to this place of search consideration. I’ll answer any questions or concerns you may
						have about your search and my services, including the associated fees and expectations
						for your search. Each search is unique – it takes time and money, and I make every effort
						to keep my costs affordable to anyone that takes this journey of discovery.
					</p>
					<p>Every individual’s life path is different. For that reason, every search case has its own set
						of circumstances and challenges. As such, the timeframe for locating the party of the
						search varies. Some cases are solved within weeks, others take months or possibly years.
						It’s also possible that the person you are searching for may not be found. However, your
						case will be given the full attention it deserves utilizing proven investigative skills and
						resources, and we will maintain communication along the way. Most importantly, prepare
						to be patient. A successful search can be an amazing, lifechanging experience.
					</p>
					<p>When you are ready – I’m ready. After the initial consultation, and you are ready to
						proceed with the search, let’s take your discovery journey together. Contact me

				<p>Often, siblings of adult adoptees aren’t aware that they can initiate a search for their
					biological siblings. I have found that the choice to initiate a search can be an emotional
					journey and each situation is slightly different, but rarely any less awaited. The sibling
					search process, in most aspects, is a mirror to the post adoption search process for the
					adoption triad (adoptee, birth parent and adoptive parent).
				</p>
				<p>It is important for me to understand why you are considering a search and what your
					expectations are. We’ll start with a simple free consultation. We’ll discuss your desired
					results of the search, and I’ll answer any questions or concerns you may have about your
					search and my services - including any prerequisites required for a sibling search. We’ll
					discuss the associated fees for your search and what you can expect during the process.
				</p>
				<p>It is also important to understand that searching takes time, money and patience. No two
					cases are alike, and there is no definitive answer to the question “How long will it take?”
					It can take weeks, months or years, with the possibility that the party of your search may
					not be found. However, a successful search can also be an amazing experience! For these
					reasons, it’s always a good idea to be prepared for either outcome.
				</p>
				<p>When you are ready to go take the next step with your search, we can walk your path of
					discovery together. Your case will be handled with compassion, sensitivity, and integrity,
					partnered with open dialogue along the way.
				</p>
				<p>The next step may seem like a big one, but it really is simple to initiate. I’m

				<p>
					DNA testing has become very popular, and many individuals submit their tests in
					anticipation of learning their ethnic background – “where do my ancestors come from?”.
					Most adoptees submit their DNA tests in hopes of finding their biological family
					connections. Some people are simply fascinated by the discovery of their family history
					and building an ancestral tree. Discovering your family’s genealogical tree and genetic
					tree are not one in the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					A person’s genealogical tree identifies all their ancestors of each generation – some are
					known (generally the parents, siblings and often the grandparents), others are not and
					must be researched. The genealogical tree is developed and supported by original
					documents such as birth and marriage records, immigration and passenger manifests,
					naturalization papers, pictures, memories, and family history mementoes that tell your
					family’s story, often passed down by the generations. A person’s genetic tree is
					developed from only their ancestors whose recombination and inheritance patterns of
					DNA contributed to the make-up of that person’s DNA. A key point to know – a person
					does not inherit DNA from all their ancestors in a genealogical tree because of the
					random recombination and inheritance pattern of the DNA. Adoptees generally don’t
					know who their biological family members are and don’t have a starting point to build
					their genealogical tree. DNA testing is often their starting point in hopes of discovering
					someone who is genetically related to them has also DNA tested, and potentially
					connecting with them.
				</p>
				<p>
					When searching for your family, all sources used to develop a family’s connections must
					be researched with great care and accuracy. There is always the potential to unearth
					unexpected information - either a missing relationship that you expected to find, or
					possibly encountering an unexpected relationship you weren’t aware of. It’s important to
					consider your reasons for conducting your genealogical search or doing a DNA test. It’s
					also very important to review a DNA testing company’s Terms of Service and Consent
					Agreements prior to administering the test.
				</p>
				<p>
					Genealogical family research or DNA evidence, alone, do not answer every question
					about your family relationship discovery. It is my focus to assist you with understanding
					the DNA results and relationship matches. I also assist with developing your genealogical
					tree by researching information, not just attaching random ‘hints’ that may or may not be
					accurate. I put the pieces of your family discoveries together for you.
				</p>
				<p>I look forward to opening the doors of discovery with you. It all starts with a simple
					phone consultation.
